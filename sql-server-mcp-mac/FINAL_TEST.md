## Current Configuration

**Server**: THARANA
**Database**: MWVGDB
**Username**: mcp_user
**Password**: MCP_SecurePass2024!
**Authentication**: SQL Server Authentication
**Driver**: ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server

## Final Steps

### Step 1: Verify Password in Claude Config

Check that the password in your config matches **exactly**:

`c:\Users\thara\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Should have:
```json
"SQL_PASSWORD": "MCP_SecurePass2024!"
```

**Important**: The password must match exactly what you used to connect in SSMS.

If you used a different password in SSMS, update the config to match.

---

### Step 2: Restart Claude Desktop

1. **Close Claude Desktop completely**
2. **Wait 5 seconds**
3. **Reopen Claude Desktop**

---

### Step 3: Test the Connection

Ask Claude Desktop:
```
List all tables in the MWVGDB database
```

---

### Step 4: Check Logs (If It Fails)

If you still get an error:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. **Help** â†’ **View Logs**
3. Look for these lines:

**For SQL Auth, you should see:**
```
=== SQL Server Authentication ===
Server: THARANA
Database: MWVGDB
Username: mcp_user
Password length: 20
```

**Success:**
```
Successfully connected to SQL Server
```

**If you see an error**, share the exact error message and I'll help fix it.

## Troubleshooting

### If password doesn't match:

The password you used in SSMS might be different. Check what you used:

1. In SSMS, check your saved connection
2. Or, reset the password to a known value:

```sql
ALTER LOGIN mcp_user WITH PASSWORD = 'MCP_SecurePass2024!';
```

Then update the config and restart Claude Desktop.

---

### If connection times out:

1. Check SQL Server is running
2. Check firewall isn't blocking port 1433
3. Try connecting to "localhost" instead of "THARANA" in the config

---

### If "driver not found" error:

The code is trying both connection methods. If one fails, check the logs to see which driver is being used.

---

## Expected Success

When working, you'll see in Claude Desktop:
- âœ… No authentication errors
- âœ… List of all tables from MWVGDB database
- âœ… Can describe table structures
- âœ… Can search for columns and relationships
- âœ… Can execute SELECT queries

---

## What Password Did You Use in SSMS?

**Important question**: When you connected to SSMS as mcp_user just now, what password did you use?

- **A)** MCP_SecurePass2024!
- **B)** MySecurePassword123!
- **C)** Something else?

Make sure the config has the **exact same password**.

---

You're so close! Since SSMS connection works, the MCP server should work too. Just need to ensure the password matches! ðŸš€
