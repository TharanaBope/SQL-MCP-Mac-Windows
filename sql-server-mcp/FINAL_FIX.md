# âœ… FINAL FIX - Certificate Trust Issue

## Problem
Getting error: `self-signed certificate` when connecting to SQL Server.

## Root Cause
SQL Server is using a self-signed certificate (common in local development), and the connection needs to explicitly trust it.

## Solution Applied âœ…

Updated the connection string to include `TrustServerCertificate=Yes;`

**Before:**
```
Driver=msnodesqlv8;Server=THARANA;Database=MWVGDB;Trusted_Connection=Yes;
```

**After:**
```
Driver=msnodesqlv8;Server=THARANA;Database=MWVGDB;Trusted_Connection=Yes;TrustServerCertificate=Yes;
```

This tells the SQL client to accept the self-signed certificate from your local SQL Server instance.

### Issue 1: ~~Tedious doesn't support Windows Auth~~
- **Fixed**: Switched to `mssql` + `msnodesqlv8`

### Issue 2: ~~ConnectionPool is not a constructor~~
- **Fixed**: Corrected ES module import syntax

### Issue 3: ~~Self-signed certificate error~~
- **Fixed**: Added `TrustServerCertificate=Yes` to connection string

## ðŸ”§ Connection Details

Your final working configuration:

**Server**: THARANA
**Database**: MWVGDB
**Authentication**: Windows (Trusted_Connection)

**Connection String**:
```
Driver=msnodesqlv8;
Server=THARANA;

## ðŸ’¡ Using the MCP Server

Once connected, you can ask Claude:

### Schema Exploration
- "What tables are in MWVGDB?"
- "Describe the [TableName] table structure"
- "Show me all columns in the [TableName] table"

### Finding Information
- "Search for tables with 'patient' in the name"
- "Where is the CustomerID column used?"
- "Find all tables that reference the Users table"

### Relationships
- "How are Orders and OrderDetails related?"
- "Show me all tables connected to Products"
- "What tables depend on the Customers table?"

### Querying Data
- "Show me the first 10 records from [TableName]"
- "Count how many records are in [TableName]"
- "Get distinct values from [ColumnName]"

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!

The MCP server is now properly configured for:
- âœ… Windows Authentication to SQL Server
- âœ… Connection to MWVGDB database
- âœ… Schema exploration and discovery
- âœ… Safe read-only queries
- âœ… RAG-style database knowledge system

Restart Claude Desktop and start exploring your database! ðŸš€
